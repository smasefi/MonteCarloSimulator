class Die:
    '''
    This class is representative of a die object. It contains 4 methods. The die method replicates 
    the behavior of a dice.

    1. __init__: This method initializes the die object with a list of faces and an optional weight.
    2. change_weight: This method allows the user to change the weight of a specific face on the die.
    3. roll: This method simulates rolling the die a specified number of times and returns the results.
    4. currState: This method returns the current state of the die, including the faces and their weights.

        what a die would look like by taking in a list of integers or strings and an optional weight. The weight
